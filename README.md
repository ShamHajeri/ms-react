# Myspace
The My-space project represents a comprehensive demonstration of my proficiency in web development technologies, encompassing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js. This project is meticulously designed to incorporate advanced concepts such as Redux for state management and the implementation of a router for seamless navigation. Through the meticulous integration of these technologies, the My-space project not only showcases my adept understanding of front-end development but also highlights my ability to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces. The incorporation of Redux underscores my commitment to efficient state management, while the inclusion of a router demonstrates my mastery of creating a smooth and intuitive user experience. This project serves as a testament to my skills in leveraging cutting-edge web development tools and frameworks to craft sophisticated and responsive applications

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
